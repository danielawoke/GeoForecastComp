In /basicNerualNetapproach you'll find a construction of a nerual network with documented python code.

I used a genetic algorthim to adjust the weights in the training phase of the model. At the momment 50*50=2500 mututations are created, and a single best one is selected for redefinition of each layer's weights as the function back propagates.
